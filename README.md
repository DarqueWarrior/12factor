# The Twelve-Factor App

Showing how to create a [Tweleve-Factor app](http://12factor.net/) using [ASP.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-dbrown) and [Azure DevOps](http://bit.ly/Core12Factor).

Each factor will live in a branch for that factor.  The master branch will contain the completed project.

### Branch 1: Codebase

One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

### Branch 2: Dependencies

Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

### Branch 3: Config

Store config in the environment

### Branch 4: Backing services

Treat backing services as attached resources

### Branch 5: Build, release, run

Strictly separate build and run stages

### Branch 6: Processes

Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

### Branch 7: Port binding

Export services via port binding

### Branch 8: Concurrency

Scale out via the process model

### Branch 9: Disposability

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

### Branch 10: Dev/prod parity

Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

### Branch 11: Logs

Treat logs as event streams

### Branch 12: Admin processes

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
